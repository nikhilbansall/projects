Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a project I created as a beginner to practice my web development skills.

Features
Play Tic Tac Toe against a friend.
Simple and intuitive user interface.

How to Play
Open index.html in your web browser.
Players take turns clicking on empty squares to make their moves.
The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
If all squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw.

Project Structure
index.html: HTML file containing the structure of the game.
style.css: CSS file for styling the game.
script.js: JavaScript file containing the game logic.
